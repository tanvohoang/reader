HTML5 Comic Book Reader
=======================

A CBR/CBZ reader. This was originally built in 2012 and made use of the FileSystem API. It should now work without that and in most modern browsers. I didn't update the embedded Bootstrap or jQuery but that should be possible if someone wants to make a PR.
